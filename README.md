This is a Xccelerate Full Time Data Science Bootcamp Cohort 3 group project, that we practice our skills in building machine learning models.

Riding on the Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects#ks-projects-201801.csv) regarding kickstarter projects, we try to build ML models to address:
* Creators' concern about the fund amount being raised
* Backers' concern about whether a campaign be successful  

**Skills**: data understanding, visualisation, data transformation, machine learning models

## Table of Contents
For detail please refer to the jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/youonf/kickstarter/blob/master/notebook).
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
* Regression model for Creators (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
    * Model 1: using predicting features that are only available before the campaign starts
    * Model 2: include features that are only available **AFTER** the campaign starts (explanation included)
        * Linear Regression
        * Random Forest Regressor
    * Summary of Regression problem
* Classification model for Backers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier
    * Model: all are based on features available prior to campaign starts
    * Summary of Classification problem
* Improvement
